* All you can eat buffet? Starve yourself for 24 hours
* Get 30 credit cards to build up credit, but get them all on the same day so the they don't show up on each other's credit checks
* Only buy stocks on sale (Yesterday's price was higher than todays price)
* 2 for 1 is always better than 1 for 1
* That's a terrible picture - take it down.
* It's 50 pictures. FREE! Why not?
* Why spend your money when you can spend someone else's money?
* If it's free, it's for me
